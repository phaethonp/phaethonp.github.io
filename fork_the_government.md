# Creating tools for the Civil Society

Introduction:<br>
We propose a digital infrastructure system in alignment with Stefanos Kasselakis's vision to "Strengthen the Civil Society."<br> 
Specifically, we suggest the development of free AI-powered tools for civil society, created by an open-source developer community. A key component of this initiative is the creation of an open-source AI Large Language Model trained on Greek datasets. <br><br>

**Benefits to the public:**

* Educational: Students and educators can leverage the AI model for learning, research, and academic support.
* Economic: Entrepreneurs can utilize the model to develop applications, products, or services, potentially leading to job creation and business growth.
* Civic Engagement: The model can be used to create platforms for civic participation, enhancing democracy and governance.<br>

By offering tangible tech tools that can be used by every household and business, a political party can empower the civil society to address everyday challenges and enhance their living standards, thereby bridging the gap between policy-making and real-world impact. <br>Instead of waiting for the trickle-down effects of policies, people get immediate access to tools that can enhance their lives. This service will lay the foundation for a national digital infrastructure that enhances economic and societal progress while fostering active civic involvement.<br><br>

**A Sandbox Environment: Pioneering Citizen-Centric Solutions Outside of Parliament**

In essence, through this independent initiative, a major political entity like Syriza, especially when in opposition and lacking the power to pass projects through the parliament, seeks to **redefine the relationship between the government, political parties, and citizens**, **outside of traditional governmental structures**.<br> This initiative not only allows the party to fast-track solutions but also to test them in a real-world context. It shifts the paradigm from a top-down approach to a more collaborative, bottom-up model, creating a sandbox environment where citizens are active contributors to their own welfare and the nation's progress. <br>By doing so, the party can demonstrate its **commitment** to **innovation** and **citizen welfare**, **even when not in power**. This initiative can position Syriza, and by extension Greece, as pioneers in tech-driven, citizen-centric governance, potentially leveling or even surpassing the standards set by other advanced nations.<br>




### Connecting Open-Source Volunteers:
* Objective: Foster a global community of open-source developers around the Greek LLM project.
* Steps & Benefits:

  * Hackathons & Workshops: Organize events focused on improving the model or building applications using it.
  * Collaborative Platforms: Use platforms like GitHub for collaborative development, bug tracking, and feature suggestions.
  * Community Growth: As the model gains traction, the community of contributors will grow, leading to better improvements and innovations.

### Greek Diaspora & Global Reach

Overall, creating a Greek-tailored LLM and making it open source can have cascading benefits across education, economy, culture, and technology. It fosters a sense of community, stimulates innovation, and offers tangible tools and opportunities for Greek speakers worldwide.<br>

## Fork the government movement
"fork the government", a phrase coined by Audrey Tang, encapsulates a modern approach to governance that draws inspiration from the world of open-source software. We are providing our own "fork" on how to deploy non-governmental technology applications for the Greek Society and the Greek Diaspora

### What is it, and how it works

* Open Source Analogy: In the world of software, "forking" refers to taking the source code from one software package and starting a separate and independent development on it. This is done to either take the software in a different direction, improve it, or adapt it to specific needs. In the context of governance, "forking" can be seen as a way of suggesting that citizens can take existing public policies, services, or datasets and adapt or improve them independently.

* Citizen Participation: Tang's vision of "forking the government" advocates for more citizen involvement in the processes of governance. It's about empowering citizens to take active roles in shaping policies, services, and public initiatives.

* Digital Democracy: Audrey Tang is a strong proponent of using digital tools to enhance democracy. Tools like vTaiwan, an online platform for public deliberation, embody this ethos by allowing citizens to participate in the policy-making process directly.

* Iterative Development: Just as in software development, where updates and versions are released iteratively based on feedback and changing requirements, governance too can be seen as an iterative process. Policies and services can be continually refined based on public feedback and changing societal needs.

* Transparency: Open source thrives on transparency, with code being accessible to all. Similarly, Tang promotes a transparent government where data, decision-making processes, and rationale are open to public scrutiny.

* Collaboration: Just as open-source projects often involve collaboration from a global community of developers, modern governance can also benefit from collaborative efforts, drawing on expertise and perspectives from a broad cross-section of society.

In essence, Audrey Tang's idea of "forking the government" is about reshaping the relationship between citizens and their government, leveraging digital tools to make governance more participatory, transparent, and adaptive. It's a vision of a more agile and collaborative government, inspired by the best principles of the open-source world
