# Creating tools for the civil society
>Expanding on the initiative "fork the government" by Audrey Tang, Minister of Digital Affairs of Taiwan

## Summary<br>
We can provide immediate support measures to the Greek people with the deployment of a free open-source Artificial Intelligence model trained on Greek datasets. More specifically By fine-tuning a Large Language Model for the Greek language and fostering a community around it, the initiative aims to stimulate education, economic growth, and civic engagement, positioning Greece at the forefront of tech-driven, citizen-centric governance.

### Benefits for Greek Students and Families:
* Objective: Improve educational outcomes and provide support tools for students and families.

### Connecting Open-Source Volunteers:
* Objective: Foster a global community of open-source developers around the Greek LLM project.

###  Enabling Application Development:

### Job Creation & Startups:

### Greek Diaspora & Global Reach



In essence, the "fork the government" initiative, when driven by a major political entity like Syriza, has the potential to redefine the relationship between the government, political parties, and citizens. It shifts the paradigm from a top-down approach to a more collaborative, bottom-up model where citizens are active contributors to their own welfare and the nation's progress. This can position Greece as a pioneer in tech-driven, citizen-centric governance, leveling or even surpassing the standards set by other advanced nations.
