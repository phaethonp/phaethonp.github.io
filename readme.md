# Creating tools for the Civil Society
*"My hope is someday, when the next Aristotle is alive, we can capture the underlying worldview of that Aristotle - in a computer. And someday, some student will be able not only to read the words Aristotle wrote, but ask Aristotle a question - and get an answer!" - **Steve Jobs, 1985**.*


### Introduction
We are introducing a non-governmental public digital infrastructure initiative with the aim of reinforcing Greece's civil society, production, and labor markets. Central to this initiative is the development of AI Foundation Language Models tailored for the Greek language, a project spearheaded by an open-source developer community. These models will be constructed using cutting-edge open-source frameworks, drawing solely from publicly accessible datasets. <br><br>

In today's landscape, where AI-driven technologies are pervasive – from automation tools to voice assistants – speakers of underserved languages risk being overlooked. This oversight can place societies like Greece at a disadvantage, potentially limiting access to vital information, exacerbating educational disparities, and stifling economic and productivity growth..<br><br>

At its core, this infrastructure serves as a platform for the design and rollout of solutions uniquely tailored to the Greek economy and culture.  It acts as both a centralized and decentralized hub, supporting business endeavors and fostering community engagement through active citizen participation
We are committed to offering our models for free to individuals, businesses, and the government, promoting an AI-driven future for all<br>

### 12. What is the "Fork the Government" movement?
"fork the government", a phrase coined by Audrey Tang, encapsulates a modern approach to governance that draws inspiration from the world of open-source software. We are providing our own "fork" on how to deploy non-governmental technology applications for the Greek Society and the Greek Diaspora

#### What is it, and how it works

* **Open Source Analogy:** In the world of software, "forking" refers to taking the source code from one software package and starting a separate and independent development on it. This is done to either take the software in a different direction, improve it, or adapt it to specific needs. In the context of governance, "forking" can be seen as a way of suggesting that citizens can take existing public policies, services, or datasets and adapt or improve them independently.

* **Citizen Participation:** Tang's vision of "forking the government" advocates for more citizen involvement in the processes of governance. It's about empowering citizens to take active roles in shaping policies, services, and public initiatives.

* **Digital Democracy:** Audrey Tang is a strong proponent of using digital tools to enhance democracy. Tools like vTaiwan, an online platform for public deliberation, embody this ethos by allowing citizens to participate in the policy-making process directly.

* **Iterative Development:** Just as in software development, where updates and versions are released iteratively based on feedback and changing requirements, governance too can be seen as an iterative process. Policies and services can be continually refined based on public feedback and changing societal needs.

* **Transparency:** Open source thrives on transparency, with code being accessible to all. Similarly, Tang promotes a transparent government where data, decision-making processes, and rationale are open to public scrutiny.

* **Collaboration:** Just as open-source projects often involve collaboration from a global community of developers, modern governance can also benefit from collaborative efforts, drawing on expertise and perspectives from a broad cross-section of society.

In essence, Audrey Tang's idea of "forking the government" is about reshaping the relationship between citizens and their government, leveraging digital tools to make governance more participatory, transparent, and adaptive. It's a vision of a more agile and collaborative government, inspired by the best principles of the open-source world
